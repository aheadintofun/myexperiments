Pharma is COOKED 

Isomorphic Labs just revealed IsoDDE: an AI system that designs drugs on a computer faster than any pharma R&D >doubles AlphaFold 3 on hard targets >20x better than Boltz-2 on antibodies >beats the physics gold standard at binding >found drug pockets from sequence alone that took 15 years to discover IsoDDE isn’t new btw. They’ve already been cooking on real drug programs for YEARS: “Brilliant scientific breakthroughs for next gen medicines” already achieved —
