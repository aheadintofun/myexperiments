# Heterogeneous Lattice

## Definition
A non-uniform spatial framework where lattice sites have varying connectivity, density, and properties. Unlike regular grids, heterogeneous lattices represent realistic biological, social, or ecological structures using irregular meshes, Voronoi tessellations, or graph-based topologies.

## Key Properties
- **Variable connectivity**: Sites have different numbers of neighbors
- **Adaptive structure**: Lattice topology itself becomes a variable, not fixed
- **Context encoding**: Neighborhood structure represents the context vector
- **Biological realism**: Models variable tissue density, social networks, patchy ecosystems

## Computational Implementations
- Voronoi tessellations for irregular spatial domains
- Graph-based lattices for network topologies
- Adaptive meshes that evolve with system state
