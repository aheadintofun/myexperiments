# Trained Immunity

## Definition
Epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells (monocytes, macrophages, NK cells) following exposure to stimuli, resulting in enhanced responsiveness to subsequent challenges. This is **innate immune memory**—a functional analog of adaptive memory without gene rearrangement or clonal expansion.

## The Paradigm Shift

**Classical view**:
- **Adaptive immunity** (B/T cells): Has memory via clonal selection
- **Innate immunity** (monocytes, macrophages, NK cells): No memory, fixed responses

**New understanding** (Mihai Netea, 2011):
- Innate cells can be "trained" by prior exposure
- Memory persists weeks to months (shorter than adaptive memory)
- Mediated by **epigenetic modifications**, not genetic recombination

## Mechanisms

### Epigenetic Reprogramming
**Histone modifications**:
- **H3K4me3** (trimethylation): Mark of active promoters
- **H3K27ac** (acetylation): Mark of active enhancers
- Training → persistent histone marks at immune gene loci
- **Result**: Chromatin accessibility increases, genes primed for rapid expression

**DNA methylation**:
- Changes in CpG methylation patterns
- Less characterized than histone marks in trained immunity

### Metabolic Rewiring
**Glycolysis upregulation**:
- Trained cells shift to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect)
- Increased glucose consumption, lactate production
- Fuels rapid pro-inflammatory responses

**Cholesterol synthesis**:
- Mevalonate pathway activation
- Accumulation of metabolic intermediates (fumarate, mevalonate)
- Metabolites directly modulate histone-modifying enzymes

**Metabolic-epigenetic coupling**: Metabolism shapes epigenetic state, which determines functional capacity.

### Long-Lived Reprogramming
**Duration**: Weeks to months (vs years for adaptive memory)

**Cell turnover**:
- Monocytes circulate ~3 days → reprogramming must affect progenitors
- **Bone marrow progenitors** (HSCs, myeloid progenitors) are reprogrammed
- Newly-produced monocytes inherit trained phenotype

This is **heritable epigenetic state** transmitted through cell divisions (but not germline).

## Inducers of Trained Immunity

### Microbial Products
- **BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin)**: Attenuated Mycobacterium bovis vaccine
- **β-glucan**: Fungal cell wall component (Candida)
- **LPS**: Low-dose bacterial endotoxin (tolerance vs training depends on dose/timing)

### Host-Derived Signals
- **Oxidized LDL (oxLDL)**: Atherosclerosis-associated signal
- **Uric acid crystals**: NLRP3 inflammasome activator
- **Lactate**: Metabolite from glycolysis

## Functional Consequences

### Enhanced Responsiveness
After training, innate cells show:
- **Increased cytokine production**: TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β (faster, stronger)
- **Improved pathogen killing**: Enhanced phagocytosis, ROS production
- **Lower activation threshold**: Respond to previously subthreshold stimuli

**Not antigen-specific**: Training by BCG enhances response to unrelated pathogens.

### Heterologous Protection
**BCG vaccination** protects against non-TB infections:
- Reduced respiratory infections in neonates
- Lower all-cause mortality (beyond TB prevention)
- **Mechanism**: Trained innate cells provide broad antimicrobial defense

This is **non-specific immunity**—unlike adaptive memory (antigen-specific).

## Clinical Relevance

### BCG as Immunotherapy
**Bladder cancer**:
- BCG instillation into bladder (standard treatment)
- Trains local immune cells → anti-tumor immunity
- **Success**: Prevents recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer

**COVID-19**:
- **Observational studies**: BCG-vaccinated populations had lower COVID-19 severity
- **Clinical trials**: Testing BCG as adjunct to reduce infection risk (mixed results)

### Atherosclerosis
**Maladaptive training**:
- OxLDL trains monocytes → pro-inflammatory macrophages
- Enhanced inflammation in arterial plaques
- **Contributes to**: Accelerated atherosclerosis

Trained immunity can be **protective or pathological** depending on context.

### Sepsis
**Endotoxin tolerance**:
- Repeated low-dose LPS → decreased inflammatory responses (tolerance, opposite of training)
- Protective against septic shock
- **But**: Increased susceptibility to secondary infections (immunoparalysis)

**Training vs tolerance**: Dose, timing, and context determine outcome.

## Innate vs Adaptive Memory: Comparison

| Feature | Adaptive Memory | Trained Immunity |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Cells** | B/T lymphocytes | Monocytes, macrophages, NK cells |
| **Mechanism** | V(D)J recombination, clonal selection | Epigenetic reprogramming |
| **Specificity** | Antigen-specific (high) | Non-specific (broad) |
| **Duration** | Years to lifetime | Weeks to months |
| **Speed** | 5-7 days (primary), 1-3 days (secondary) | Hours (if cells pre-trained) |
| **Inheritance** | Clonal (daughter cells) | Progenitor-dependent (bone marrow) |

**Complementary systems**: Trained immunity provides early broad defense; adaptive memory provides late specific defense.

## Evolutionary Perspective

**Invertebrates** lack adaptive immunity but show immune priming:
- Insects, mollusks show enhanced resistance after infection
- Likely epigenetic mechanisms (similar to trained immunity)

**Vertebrates** have both:
- Trained immunity (ancient, conserved)
- Adaptive immunity (evolved ~500 million years ago)

Trained immunity is an **evolutionarily ancient** form of immunological memory.

## Future Directions

### Vaccine Adjuvants
Using training inducers to boost vaccine efficacy:
- β-glucan as adjuvant (enhances innate responses)
- BCG co-administration with other vaccines

### Cancer Immunotherapy
Combining checkpoint blockade with trained immunity induction:
- Enhanced tumor infiltration by trained myeloid cells
- Synergy with adaptive anti-tumor responses

### Precision Medicine
**Inter-individual variation**:
- Genetic polymorphisms affect trainability
- Metabolic state influences epigenetic reprogramming
- **Personalized**: Predict who benefits from training-based interventions
