# Cachexia as Phase Transition

## Definition
Cachexia is a systemic wasting syndrome where the body's tissues undergo coordinated catabolism. Viewed through the lattice framework, it represents a **phase transition propagating across the entire organism lattice**—not localized to the tumor but a systemic rewriting of update rules at every node.

## Systemic Dissection
The body undergoes pathological equidecomposition:
- **Skeletal muscle**: Catabolized (protein reserves liquefied)
- **Adipose tissue**: Lipolyzed (energy stores redistributed)
- **Liver**: Reprogrammed to acute phase response
- **Gut barrier**: Degraded (boundary between self and microbiome dissolving)
- **Hypothalamus**: Circuits rewired (appetite, thermogenesis altered)

## Background Consuming Foreground
Conventional view: Tumor (foreground) parasitizes host (background). Reality: The host's own tissues are systematically dissected and rearranged. **The tumor edits the rules of the lattice itself.**

## Conserved Quantity Puzzle
What is conserved in cachexia? Not mass (patient loses mass), not area. Possibly:
- Entropy production rate
- Energy flux to tumor (maximized at expense of everything else)
- Pathological optimization: minimize host viability, maximize tumor resource availability

## Symmetry Breaking
Normal homeostasis is dynamic symmetry—anabolism and catabolism balanced. Cachexia breaks this symmetry unidirectionally toward catabolism via systemic signals: TNF-α, IL-6, activin A, GDF-15, PTHrP.
