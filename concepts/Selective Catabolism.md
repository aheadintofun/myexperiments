# Selective Catabolism

## Definition
Targeted breakdown of damaged, senescent, or suboptimal cellular components while preserving or enhancing functional structures. Contrasts with the indiscriminate catabolism of cachexia, selective catabolism is the mechanism underlying regenerative processes.

## Mechanisms

### Autophagy
- Cellular self-digestion of specific components
- Targets: Damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, pathogens
- Quality control at molecular level
- Micro-dissection followed by rebuilding

### Immune Surveillance
- Clearance of senescent cells
- Elimination of pre-cancerous cells
- Tissue remodeling through controlled cell death
- Macro-dissection at cellular level

### Tissue Remodeling
- Exercise-induced muscle damage → enhanced rebuilding
- Bone remodeling: Osteoclasts remove old bone, osteoblasts build new
- Wound healing: Debridement of damaged tissue, regeneration

## Key Property: Context-Dependent Targeting
What gets catabolized depends on:
- Quality metrics (damage, dysfunction)
- Environmental signals (stress, nutrients)
- Developmental or circadian timing
- Systemic regulatory state

## Inversion of Cachexia
Cachexia: Indiscriminate liquidation of all tissues → serve tumor
Selective catabolism: Targeted removal of suboptimal → serve organism

Same catabolic machinery, opposite selectivity.

## Temporal Pattern Matters
Many signals that drive cachexia chronically drive beneficial selective catabolism acutely:
- IL-6: Chronic → cachexia; Pulsed (exercise) → adaptation
- Glucocorticoids: Chronic → muscle wasting; Acute → stress response
- Pattern is part of the signal
