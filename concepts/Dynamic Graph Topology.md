# Dynamic Graph Topology

## Definition
Graph structures where the connectivity pattern itself evolves over time, not just node states. The **topology is a dynamical variable**—edges and vertices can be created, deleted, or rewired according to local rules.

## Contrast with Fixed Topology
**Fixed topology** (standard [[Cellular Automata Framework]], [[Graph Cellular Automata]]):
- Network structure predetermined and static
- Only node states evolve: $\mathcal{S}(t) \to \mathcal{S}(t+1)$
- Adjacency matrix $\mathcal{A}$ constant

**Dynamic topology** ([[Graph Rewriting Automata]]):
- Network structure changes during evolution
- Both states and connections evolve: $\{\mathcal{A}(t), \mathcal{S}(t)\} \to \{\mathcal{A}(t+1), \mathcal{S}(t+1)\}$
- Adjacency matrix is time-dependent: $\mathcal{A}(t)$

## Topology-Behavior Coupling
The defining feature of dynamic topology systems:

> "Network topology and node states are coupled critically—**nodes' behavior is constrained by structure which is generated by nodes' behavior**."

This creates a feedback loop:
1. Current topology determines local neighborhoods
2. Neighborhoods constrain possible state transitions
3. State transitions trigger topology changes
4. New topology creates new neighborhoods → (1)

See [[Topology-Behavior Coupling]] for emergence implications.

## Mechanisms of Topological Change

### Vertex Division
- Parent vertex → complete subgraph of daughters
- New vertices, new edges created simultaneously
- Biological: [[Cell Division as Vertex Division]]

### Edge Rewiring
- Existing connections broken, new connections formed
- Depends on node states and local configuration
- Neural plasticity, vascular remodeling

### Vertex Deletion
- Node removal + edge pruning
- Apoptosis, predation, extinction

## Why Dynamic Topology Matters

### Biological Reality
Real biological networks are not static:
- Developmental morphogenesis: cell number increases
- Neural development: synaptic pruning and formation
- Vascular networks: angiogenesis
- Ecosystems: species enter/leave food web

Fixed-topology models miss these essential dynamics.

### Emergent Complexity
Dynamic topology enables:
- **Growth**: networks can expand/contract
- **Self-assembly**: structure emerges from interaction rules
- **Adaptation**: topology reconfigures in response to perturbations
- **Hierarchical structure**: modules emerge via topological evolution

## Mathematical Representation
Adjacency matrix as function of time and local states:

$$\mathcal{A}_{ij}(t+1) = R(\mathcal{A}(t), \mathcal{S}_i(t), \mathcal{S}_j(t), \{\mathcal{S}_k(t) : k \in \mathcal{N}(i) \cup \mathcal{N}(j)\})$$

where $R$ is the local rewriting rule, and $\mathcal{N}(v)$ is neighborhood of vertex $v$.
