# Origin of Life

## Definition
The transition from **non-living chemistry to living biology**—the emergence of self-replicating, metabolizing, evolving systems from prebiotic matter. Date: ~3.5-4.0 billion years ago.

## Abstract Principle
**What changed**: **Matter began to compute, replicate, and evolve**.

Life is not a substance, but a **process**:
- **Information storage and replication**: Heredity
- **Metabolism**: Energy capture, chemical transformation
- **Evolution**: Variation + selection → adaptation

## The Minimal Requirements
What is the simplest system that qualifies as "alive"?

### Three Essential Functions
1. **Metabolism**: Extract energy/matter from environment
2. **Replication**: Make copies of self
3. **Information**: Heritable blueprint enabling evolution

**Challenge**: These are **interdependent**. Need metabolism for replication, need replication to preserve metabolic machinery, need information to encode both. **Chicken-and-egg problem**.

## Major Hypotheses

### RNA World Hypothesis
**Claim**: RNA came first—single molecule performs both **information storage** and **catalysis**.

**Evidence**:
- RNA stores genetic information (like DNA)
- RNA catalyzes reactions (ribozymes: ribosome, self-splicing introns)
- RNA world could replicate and evolve without proteins or DNA

**Transition**:
- RNA → DNA (more stable information storage)
- Ribozymes → protein enzymes (more catalytic diversity)

**Problem**: RNA synthesis from prebiotic chemistry difficult (ribose, phosphate, base synthesis).

### Metabolism-First Hypothesis
**Claim**: Self-sustaining autocatalytic metabolic cycles came first.

**Examples**:
- **Iron-sulfur world** (Wächtershäuser): Mineral-catalyzed cycles on pyrite (FeS₂) surfaces
- **Autocatalytic sets**: Networks of reactions where products catalyze their own synthesis

**Advantage**: No need for complex polymers (RNA) initially.

**Problem**: How does information/heredity arise from metabolism alone?

### Replication-First (Genetic Takeover)
**Claim**: Simpler replicators preceded RNA.

**Candidates**:
- **PNA (peptide nucleic acid)**: Protein-like backbone, nucleotide bases
- **TNA (threose nucleic acid)**: Simpler sugar than ribose

**Transition**: Simple replicators → RNA → DNA/protein.

### Lipid World
**Claim**: Self-assembling lipid vesicles (protocells) provided compartmentalization, enabling localized chemistry.

**Advantage**: Compartments concentrate reactants, enable group selection (vesicles with better chemistry outcompete).

**Problem**: How do vesicles acquire metabolism, replication?

## Integrated Scenario
Likely path combined elements:

1. **Prebiotic chemistry**: Amino acids, nucleotides synthesized (Miller-Urey experiment, meteorite delivery)
2. **Compartmentalization**: Lipid vesicles form spontaneously
3. **Autocatalytic metabolism**: Mineral surfaces, FeS clusters enable redox chemistry
4. **RNA emerges**: Ribozymes catalyze reactions, replicate (imperfectly)
5. **Evolution begins**: Variation + selection → optimization
6. **Genetic takeover**: RNA → DNA (storage), proteins (catalysis)

## Key Evolutionary Transitions

### Homochirality
**Symmetry breaking**: Why L-amino acids and D-sugars (not mirror images)?

**Hypotheses**:
- Random fluctuation amplified
- Circularly polarized UV light from neutron stars
- Autocatalytic amplification of small initial bias

**Consequence**: Biological molecules are chiral. Frozen accident.

### Genetic Code
**Abstraction**: Mapping from nucleotide triplets (codons) to amino acids.

**Universality**: Nearly identical across all life (minor variations in mitochondria, some bacteria).

**Frozen accident**: Code is arbitrary, but changing it now would be catastrophic (all proteins scrambled).

### Compartmentalization
**Cell membrane**: Separates "self" from "environment".

**Consequence**: Enables individuality, units of selection, controlled internal chemistry.

## Energy Sources for Early Life
- **Chemosynthesis**: Oxidation of H₂, H₂S, Fe²⁺ (deep-sea hydrothermal vents)
- **Photosynthesis**: Evolved later (~3.5 Gya), oxygen-producing cyanobacteria (~2.4 Gya)

## Abstract Insights

### Life as Computation
Living systems process information:
- Genome = program
- Metabolism = execution
- Evolution = optimization algorithm

### Life as Dissipative Structure
Life maintains order (low entropy) by increasing environmental disorder:
- Extract free energy from environment
- Export entropy (heat, waste)
- Locally decrease entropy at expense of surroundings (2nd law satisfied globally)

### Life as Autocatalytic Network
Life is a **self-sustaining chemical network**:
- Products catalyze their own synthesis
- Network as a whole reproduces
- See Stuart Kauffman's "autocatalytic sets"

## Open Questions
- **Where?**: Hydrothermal vents, shallow pools, clay surfaces, extraterrestrial (panspermia)?
- **When?**: 3.5 Gya (definite fossils), 4.0+ Gya (isotopic evidence)?
- **How many times?**: Once (universal common ancestor) or multiple independent origins?
- **Inevitable?**: Does chemistry → life with high probability, or rare fluke?
