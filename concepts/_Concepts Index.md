## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Fundamental Principles
1. **Multi-scale structure**: Patterns recur across hierarchies (molecules → cells → organisms)
2. **Context dependence**: Same genotype, different phenotype in different contexts
3. **Temporal patterns**: Dynamics matter as much as static concentrations
4. **Many-to-many mappings**: Degeneracy and conditional genotype-phenotype relationships
5. **Emergent properties**: Higher-level behavior from lower-level local interactions

### Dynamical Themes
6. **Trajectories through state space**: Evolution as paths, not jumps
7. **Attractors as stable phenotypes**: Cell types, disease states are dynamical attractors
8. **Bifurcations as decisions**: Developmental fates, phase transitions
9. **Criticality and universality**: Systems self-organize to critical points for optimal function
10. **Symmetry breaking**: Homogeneous → patterned (developmental, ecological)

### Computational Themes
11. **Compression as mechanism**: Hierarchical compression preserves task-relevant information
12. **Prediction-to-generation shift**: From modeling nature to designing novel biology
13. **Foundation models**: Evolution compressed into learned representations
14. **Democratization**: Open weights enable global access to biological AI
15. **Renormalization**: Effective theories at each scale via coarse-graining

### Conservation and Transformation
16. **What's preserved?**: Conserved quantities during geometric/metabolic reorganization
17. **Quality metrics**: Not all equivalent configurations have equal functional value
18. **Lattice as universal substrate**: Local rules → global patterns across domains
