# Degeneracy in Biological Systems

## Definition
Multiple structurally different configurations producing equivalent functional outcomes. In cellular automata terms: different rule sets generating the same macroscopic behavior. In geometric terms: different dissections connecting the same pair of shapes.

## Examples Across Biology

### Genetic Code
- Multiple codons map to the same amino acid
- Wobble base pairing provides redundancy
- Protects against mutation

### Neural Networks
- Different connection patterns achieve same computation
- Synaptic plasticity enables multiple solutions
- Robustness through alternative pathways

### Metabolic Networks
- Alternative biochemical routes to same product
- Different enzymes catalyzing same reaction
- Backup pathways during enzyme failure

### Protein Structure
- Different amino acid sequences fold to similar structures
- Same fold supports different sequences
- Functional equivalence despite sequence divergence

## Distinction from Redundancy
- **Redundancy**: Multiple identical copies (backup)
- **Degeneracy**: Structurally different elements with equivalent function (diversity)

Degeneracy provides both robustness AND evolvability—systems can explore structural variations while maintaining function.

## Lattice Framework Interpretation
Multiple update rule sets producing equivalent macroscopic lattice behavior. The system has:
- Structural degrees of freedom (many possible implementations)
- Functional constraint (must achieve same outcome)
- Equivalence class of degenerate configurations
