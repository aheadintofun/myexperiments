# Figure-Ground Decomposition

## Definition
The context-dependent choice of what constitutes "signal" (foreground) versus "substrate" (background) in a system. The same lattice or dataset admits multiple valid figure-ground decompositions, each revealing different patterns and relationships.

## Context Dependence
What counts as foreground depends on the analytical question:
- **Tumor biology**: Tumor = foreground, tissue = background
- **Immunology**: Immune cells = foreground, tumor = background
- **Microbiome**: Microbial community = foreground, host = background

## Dissection Insight
The same lattice supports multiple valid figure-ground decompositions. Each decomposition reveals a different dissection pattern—different pieces, different equivalences. **The choice of foreground IS the analytical frame.**

## Frame-Switching as First-Class Operation
A computational platform must support:
- Multiple simultaneous decompositions of the same data
- Explicit representation of the frame choice
- Comparison of insights across different frames
- Transformation rules between frames

## Perceptual Analogy
Like the Rubin vase (faces vs vase), biological systems have inherent figure-ground ambiguity. The "correct" decomposition depends on which question you're asking.
