# Cachexia Inversion

## Definition
The therapeutic reversal of cachexia's catabolic cascade through **selective catabolism coupled to enhanced rebuilding**. Not merely absence of disease, but an active anabolic dissection that systematically enhances rather than degrades organismal function.

## Inversion Pattern
- **Cachexia**: Systemic signal → indiscriminate catabolism → resource extraction → serves parasitic demand → degradation
- **Inversion**: Systemic signal → selective catabolism → resource reallocation → serves regenerative demand → enhancement

## Physiological Examples

### Exercise as Anti-Cachexia
Controlled perturbation triggering systemic anabolic reprogramming:
- Myokines (irisin, pulsatile IL-6, BDNF) propagate anabolic signals
- Muscle rebuilding, adipose browning, mitochondrial biogenesis
- **Key insight**: Same molecule (IL-6), different temporal pattern (chronic vs pulsed), opposite outcome

### Fasting Cycles
Controlled catabolic episodes enhancing long-term anabolic capacity:
- Autophagy clears damaged components (cellular-level dissection)
- Refeeding drives regeneration with higher functional quality
- Organism disassembles and reassembles in improved configuration

## Hormesis as Operating Principle
The inversion is not cachexia's opposite (pure anabolism = cancer) but its **dual**:
- Controlled, periodic, selective catabolism
- Coupled to enhanced rebuilding
- Each cycle ratchets quality upward
- Lattice periodically disassembles and reassembles itself

## Computational Requirements
- Bidirectional state transitions (degradation AND enhancement trajectories)
- Temporal pattern sensitivity (same signal, different dynamics, different outcome)
- Quality metrics at each node (rebuilt ≠ original; may be better or worse)
- **Dissection quality score**: Does reconfiguration increase functional capacity?
