# Clonal Architecture and Selection

## Definition
Populations of cells or organisms under selection pressure, exhibiting clonal expansion, competition, and evolutionary dynamics. The same mathematical framework applies to cancer evolution, immune repertoires, and agricultural breeding.

## Universal Pattern
- Initial population with genetic/phenotypic diversity
- Selection pressure (treatment, antigen, environment)
- Clonal expansion of fit variants
- Population composition shifts over time
- Resistant/adapted subclones emerge

## Domain Implementations

### Cancer
Tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution:
- Tools: PyClone-VI, MOBSTER, Canopy, inferCNV
- Selection: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immune pressure
- Outcome: treatment resistance, metastasis

### Immunology
B/T cell clonal expansion:
- Tools: immunarch, TRUST4, scRepertoire, IgBLAST
- Selection: antigen affinity, regulatory signals
- Outcome: memory repertoire, affinity maturation

### Agriculture
Cultivar selection and breeding:
- Tools: TASSEL, GAPIT, rrBLUP, GenomicSEM
- Selection: yield, disease resistance, environmental stress
- Outcome: improved varieties, breeding values

## Mathematical Framework
Shared analytical structure:
- **Phylogenetic trees**: Clonal lineage relationships
- **Fitness landscapes**: Genotype-fitness mapping
- **Selection coefficients**: Quantifying competitive advantage
- **Coalescent theory**: Reconstructing population history
