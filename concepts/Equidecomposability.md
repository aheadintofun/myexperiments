# Equidecomposability

## Definition
Two geometric shapes are equidecomposable if one can be dissected into pieces and rearranged to form the other while conserving some quantity (area, volume). From Frederickson's "Dissections: Plane and Fancy," this concept extends beyond geometry to biological systems.

## Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwien Theorem
Any two polygons of equal area are equidecomposable—a dissection always exists, though finding the minimal-piece dissection is an optimization problem.

## Biological Interpretation
Two system states are equivalent if they can be transformed into one another while conserving some biological invariant:
- Total cell count
- Metabolic flux
- Population fitness
- Information content

## Dissection as Proof of Equivalence
A dissection provides a constructive proof that two seemingly different configurations are equivalent under the conserved quantity. This formalizes the concept of **degeneracy**—multiple configurations with equivalent function.

## Connection to Transformation
- **Minimal dissection** = Most efficient encoding of transformation
- **Pieces** = Basis elements
- **Rearrangement** = Transformation operation
