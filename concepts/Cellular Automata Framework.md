# Cellular Automata Framework

## Definition
A computational paradigm for modeling social, ecological, and biological systems where each lattice site represents an agent with a state vector, and update rules are local—each site's next state depends on its neighborhood. Global patterns emerge from local interaction rules.

## Core Mapping
- **Lattice site** = Agent (cell, organism, person, plot of land)
- **State vector** = Current condition of the agent
- **Update rule** = Function of neighborhood state
- **Global pattern** = Emergent behavior from local interactions

## Biological Applications
- Developmental biology and morphogenesis
- Tumor growth modeling
- Epidemiological spread
- Ecological succession

## Computational Substrate
The framework simultaneously supports multiple universal computational engines:
- **Trajectories**: Paths through state space on the lattice
- **Perturbation-response**: Changing rules/conditions and observing propagation
- **Symmetry-breaking**: Spontaneous pattern formation from uniform initial conditions
- **Degeneracy**: Multiple rule sets producing equivalent macroscopic behavior
