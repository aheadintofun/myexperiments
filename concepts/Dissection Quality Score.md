# Dissection Quality Score

## Definition
A metric evaluating whether a biological dissection-reassembly (catabolism-anabolism cycle) produces a configuration with higher or lower functional capacity than the original. Quantifies whether reorganization improves or degrades the system.

## Need for Quality Metrics
Standard equidecomposability conserves area or volume. In biology, we need to ask:
- Does the rebuilt muscle fiber have better or worse function?
- Is the remodeled tissue more or less resilient?
- Has metabolic efficiency increased or decreased?

The rebuilt configuration is not identical to the original—it has a quality dimension.

## Components of Quality

### Structural Metrics
- Component integrity (damage vs pristine)
- Connectivity (network robustness)
- Spatial organization (optimized vs disordered)

### Functional Metrics
- Performance under load (strength, endurance)
- Efficiency (energy cost per function)
- Adaptive capacity (response range to perturbations)

### Temporal Metrics
- Longevity of rebuilt components
- Time to next maintenance cycle
- Rate of quality degradation

## Application to Regenerative Processes

### Positive Quality Score (Enhancement)
- Exercise-induced muscle remodeling: Stronger than before
- Autophagy-mediated organelle renewal: Better than original
- Fasting-refeeding: Improved metabolic flexibility

### Negative Quality Score (Degradation)
- Cachexia-driven catabolism: Diminished capacity
- Fibrotic scarring: Inferior to original tissue
- Chronic inflammation: Cumulative damage

### Neutral Quality Score (Maintenance)
- Normal protein turnover: Preserve status quo
- Homeostatic tissue replacement: Like-for-like

## Computational Challenge
Defining objective quality metrics for:
- Multi-dimensional function spaces
- Context-dependent value (what's "better" depends on environment)
- Long-term vs short-term tradeoffs
