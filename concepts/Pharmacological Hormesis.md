# Pharmacological Hormesis

## Definition
The deliberate use of pharmaceutical interventions to trigger controlled stress responses that enhance organismal function through hormetic mechanisms. A designed perturbation that induces selective catabolism followed by enhanced anabolism—the vitality dissection without requiring exercise or fasting.

## Conceptual Goal
Identify and administer signaling programs that:
1. Trigger selective catabolism (target damaged/suboptimal components)
2. Preserve or enhance functional components
3. Induce overcompensatory anabolic response
4. Result in net improvement in functional capacity

## Contrast with Current Approaches

### Current Pharmacology
- Typically aims to block pathological processes
- Inhibit inflammation, suppress aberrant signaling
- Reduces harm but doesn't necessarily enhance

### Pharmacological Hormesis
- Aims to trigger beneficial adaptive programs
- Controlled activation of stress pathways
- Mimics exercise, fasting, or environmental challenges
- Enhances beyond baseline, not just prevents decline

## Potential Mechanisms

### Autophagy Induction
- Rapamycin (mTOR inhibition)
- Spermidine
- Triggers cellular quality control

### Mitochondrial Stress
- Metformin (mild complex I inhibition)
- Induces mitochondrial biogenesis through hormetic stress

### Controlled Inflammation
- Pulsatile cytokine administration (vs chronic)
- Temporal pattern engineered for adaptation, not damage

## Research Question
Can we identify the complete signaling program that induces the **selective-catabolic-then-enhanced-anabolic cycle** systematically?

This would require:
- Understanding which signals determine selectivity
- Temporal pattern engineering (pulse shape, frequency, duration)
- Combinatorial optimization (multiple signals coordinated)
- Personalization (context-dependent dosing)

## Challenges
- Dose-response optimization (hormetic window is narrow)
- Temporal pattern engineering (not just drug levels, but patterns)
- Selectivity control (avoid triggering cachexia-like indiscriminate catabolism)
- Individual variation (hormetic response varies by genetic/epigenetic context)
