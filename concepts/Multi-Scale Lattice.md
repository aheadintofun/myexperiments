# Multi-Scale Lattice

## Definition
A hierarchical lattice structure where each "cell" is itself a lattice, enabling modeling across biological scales. Nested lattices represent different organizational levels: intracellular networks embedded in tissue lattices, embedded in organism lattices, embedded in population lattices.

## Hierarchical Composition
- **Intracellular level**: Protein interaction networks, metabolic pathways
- **Tissue level**: Cell-cell communication, spatial organization
- **Organism level**: Organ systems, physiological regulation
- **Population level**: Individual organisms in ecological/social context

## Renormalization Connection
Coarse-graining question: What are the effective update rules when moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained scale? This connects to renormalization group ideas from statistical physics.

## Key Insight
The same formal structure applies at all scales—the difference is only in the physical interpretation of the lattice sites and update rules.
