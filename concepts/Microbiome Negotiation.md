# Microbiome Negotiation

## Definition
The immunological accommodation of commensal microorganisms—bacteria, fungi, viruses residing on and within the body. This is **mutualistic non-self tolerance**: The immune system permits beneficial foreign organisms to inhabit barrier tissues while maintaining defense against pathogens.

## The Commensal Paradox

**Numbers**:
- Human cells: ~30 trillion
- Microbial cells: ~40 trillion (mostly gut bacteria)
- Microbial genes: ~5 million (vs ~20,000 human genes)

**Challenge**:
- Commensals are non-self (foreign genomes)
- Express PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns)
- In direct contact with immune system (gut, skin, airways)

**Why not rejected?** Active tolerance mechanisms distinguish commensals from pathogens.

## Anatomical Sites

### Gut Microbiome
Largest microbial community (~10^14 bacteria):
- **Dominant phyla**: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes
- **Functions**: Nutrient metabolism, vitamin synthesis, pathogen exclusion, immune education
- **Diversity**: 500-1000 species per individual

### Skin Microbiome
- **Sebaceous sites**: Propionibacterium acnes
- **Moist sites**: Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium
- **Dry sites**: Mixed communities

### Oral Microbiome
- ~700 bacterial species
- Biofilm formation on teeth (plaque)

### Other Sites
- Airways (lung microbiome)
- Urogenital tract
- Conjunctiva (eye)

## Mechanisms of Tolerance

### Physical Barriers
**Mucus layer**:
- Separates bacteria from epithelial cells
- Goblet cells secrete mucins (MUC2)
- **Outer layer**: Bacteria colonize
- **Inner layer**: Sterile, protects epithelium

**Tight junctions**:
- Seal epithelial cells
- Prevent bacterial translocation
- Breakdown → inflammation (leaky gut)

### IgA Antibodies
**Secretory IgA (sIgA)**:
- Transcytosed across epithelium into lumen
- Binds commensal bacteria **without activating complement**
- **Immune exclusion**: Prevents bacterial adhesion to epithelium
- **Coating**: Limits pro-inflammatory responses

IgA is **tolerogenic antibody**—recognizes but doesn't attack.

### Regulatory T Cells
Gut Tregs induced by commensal antigens:
- Recognize bacterial antigens
- Suppress inflammatory responses
- Secrete IL-10, TGF-β

**Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB)**: Induce both Th17 cells (pro-inflammatory) and Tregs (regulatory)—balanced immunity.

### Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)
Epithelial cells express:
- **TLRs** (Toll-like receptors): Recognize PAMPs
- **Basolateral localization**: Only respond to bacteria that breach barrier
- **Hyporesponsiveness**: Chronic PAMP exposure → tolerance

### Antimicrobial Peptides
Paneth cells (gut) secrete:
- **α-defensins**, **lysozyme**, **RegIII γ**
- Selective killing: Target pathogens more than commensals
- **Spatial segregation**: Keep bacteria away from epithelium

## Benefits of Commensals

### Colonization Resistance
Commensals exclude pathogens:
- **Niche competition**: Occupy binding sites, consume nutrients
- **Bacteriocins**: Antimicrobial compounds killing competitors
- **Immune priming**: Maintain "prepared" immune state

### Metabolic Functions
- **Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)**: Butyrate, acetate, propionate (energy source, anti-inflammatory)
- **Vitamin synthesis**: Vitamin K, B vitamins
- **Bile acid metabolism**: Secondary bile acids modulate immunity
- **Xenobiotic metabolism**: Drug breakdown, detoxification

### Immune Education
**Hygiene hypothesis**: Lack of microbial exposure → dysregulated immunity
- Germ-free mice: Underdeveloped immune system, increased autoimmunity/allergy
- **Critical window**: Early-life microbiome shapes lifelong immunity

## Dysbiosis and Disease

**Dysbiosis**: Microbial imbalance or dysfunction

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
- Loss of microbial diversity
- Expansion of pathobionts (Enterobacteriaceae)
- Breakdown of mucus barrier
- **Result**: Chronic intestinal inflammation (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)

### Metabolic Disease
- Obesity-associated microbiome changes
- Increased energy harvest from diet
- Systemic low-grade inflammation (metabolic endotoxemia)

### Autoimmunity
- **Type 1 diabetes**: Altered gut microbiome in high-risk children
- **Multiple sclerosis**: Dysbiosis precedes disease onset
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Porphyromonas gingivalis (oral pathogen) linked to disease

### Allergic Disease
- Reduced microbial diversity → Th2 skewing → atopy
- **Protective strains**: Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium

## Therapeutic Manipulation

### Probiotics
Live microorganisms conferring health benefits:
- **Strains**: Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces boulardii
- **Evidence**: Variable (some strains effective for specific conditions)

### Prebiotics
Dietary fibers promoting beneficial bacteria:
- **Inulin**, **fructooligosaccharides (FOS)**
- Fermented to SCFAs

### Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT)
Transfer of donor stool to recipient:
- **Highly effective**: Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (>90% cure)
- **Experimental**: IBD, metabolic disease, autism

### Microbial Engineering
- **Engineered bacteria**: CRISPR-modified commensals to deliver therapeutics
- **Synthetic ecology**: Designer microbial consortia

## Boundary Negotiation Perspective

Microbiome tolerance is **negotiated co-residence**:
- Commensals are non-self (foreign genomes)
- But immune system grants **residential status** based on:
  - **Spatial confinement** (mucus barrier)
  - **Beneficial signals** (SCFAs, immune education)
  - **Absence of invasion** (don't breach epithelium)

This is **conditional tolerance with enforced boundaries**—commensals permitted on epithelial surface, not in tissues.

The phenotypic boundary is **layered**:
- Self (host cells)
- Mutualistic non-self (commensals, tolerated in specific compartments)
- Pathogenic non-self (to be eliminated)
