# Oligomeric State Switching

## Definition
Proteins that exhibit different functions depending on their assembly state: monomer, dimer, tetramer, higher-order oligomers. Same polypeptide sequence, different quaternary structures → different biochemical activities.

## Mechanism
Assembly state changes expose/hide functional sites:
- **Oligomeric interfaces** bury/expose active sites
- **Allosteric regulation** transmitted through subunit contacts
- **Conformational selection** favors function-specific geometries

## Key Examples

### GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
- **Tetramer** (cytoplasm): Glycolytic enzyme
- **Monomer** (nucleus): Transcription factor, RNA binding, apoptosis regulator
- Dissociation exposes nuclear localization signal

### DegP Protease/Chaperone
- **Low temperature**: Hexamer, chaperone activity (substrate binding without cleavage)
- **High temperature**: Dodecamer (12-mer or 24-mer), protease activity (degrades misfolded proteins)
- Temperature-sensing quality control system

### p53 Tumor Suppressor
- **Tetramer**: Active transcription factor (DNA binding)
- **Monomer**: Inactive, subject to degradation
- Oligomerization stabilizes and activates

### Hemoglobin
- **Tetramer**: Cooperative oxygen binding (allosteric)
- **Dimer**: Lower oxygen affinity, pathological in some conditions
- Quaternary structure enables cooperativity

## Functional Basis
Different oligomeric states provide:
- **Active site geometry**: Subunit arrangement creates/disrupts catalytic sites
- **Substrate access**: Interfaces gate substrate entry
- **Allosteric communication**: Subunits transmit regulatory signals
- **Localization signals**: Buried/exposed trafficking sequences

## Regulation
Oligomeric equilibrium controlled by:
- **Concentration** (mass action)
- **Post-translational modifications** (phosphorylation, acetylation)
- **Binding partners** (stabilize specific states)
- **Environmental conditions** (pH, temperature, ionic strength, oxidation)

## Connection to Equidecomposability
Same subunit "pieces" assembled into different higher-order architectures:
- Monomer vs. dimer vs. tetramer = different spatial arrangements
- Function arises from assembly geometry, not sequence change
- Like geometric dissection: same parts, different configurations

## Evolutionary Advantage
Oligomeric switching provides:
- **Functional versatility** from single gene
- **Context-dependent regulation** via assembly control
- **Economical proteome**: One protein, multiple roles
