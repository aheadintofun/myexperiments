# Immune Tolerance

## Definition
The active maintenance of non-reactivity to self-antigens. Not the mere absence of immune response, but specific cellular and molecular mechanisms that suppress potentially autoreactive lymphocytes. Tolerance is the enforced boundary between self and non-self.

## Central vs Peripheral Tolerance

### Central Tolerance (Primary Lymphoid Organs)
**Thymus (T cells)**:
- Positive selection: T cells recognizing self-MHC survive
- Negative selection: High-affinity self-reactive T cells deleted (apoptosis)
- AIRE-mediated expression: Tissue antigens displayed for tolerance induction
- Result: ~95% of developing T cells eliminated

**Bone marrow (B cells)**:
- Receptor editing: Self-reactive BCRs undergo secondary rearrangement
- Clonal deletion: High-affinity self-reactive B cells eliminated
- Anergy induction: Functional inactivation of moderate self-reactivity

### Peripheral Tolerance (Tissues)
Mechanisms active throughout life:
- **Regulatory T cells (Tregs)**: CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells actively suppress immune responses
- **Anergy**: Antigen recognition without costimulation → functional inactivation
- **Exhaustion**: Chronic antigen exposure → progressive functional impairment
- **Activation-induced cell death (AICD)**: Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis of activated cells
- **Immune privilege**: Brain, eye, testis protected by anatomical barriers

## Regulatory T Cells (Tregs)

**Mechanism of suppression**:
- Secretion of IL-10, TGF-β (inhibitory cytokines)
- CTLA-4 expression (outcompetes CD28 for costimulation)
- IL-2 consumption (depriving effector cells)
- Direct cytotoxicity via granzyme/perforin

**Origin**:
- Natural Tregs (nTregs): Thymic development
- Induced Tregs (iTregs): Peripheral conversion from conventional T cells

Tregs are the **active boundary enforcers**—not passive tolerance but active suppression.

## Failure Modes

### Loss of Tolerance → Autoimmunity
When tolerance mechanisms fail:
- **Type 1 diabetes**: T cells attack pancreatic beta cells
- **Multiple sclerosis**: T cells attack myelin sheaths
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Immune attack on joint tissues
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus**: Antibodies against nuclear antigens

Autoimmunity is **boundary failure inward**—self misclassified as non-self.

### IPEX Syndrome
Mutation in FoxP3 (Treg transcription factor):
- Nonfunctional regulatory T cells
- Systemic autoimmunity from birth
- Demonstrates Tregs are essential, not redundant

## Tolerance as Active Computation

Tolerance is not default non-response but **active suppression**:
- Energy expenditure: Maintaining Treg populations
- Continuous surveillance: Monitoring for autoreactive cells
- Context integration: Same antigen → tolerance or immunity based on danger signals
- Learned representation: Tolerance shaped by developmental exposure

This is computational work—phenotypic boundary enforcement costs resources.

## Induction of Tolerance (Therapeutic)

Intentional tolerance induction:
- **Oral tolerance**: Feeding antigen induces mucosal tolerance (allergy therapy)
- **Transplant tolerance**: Inducing acceptance of donor organs
- **Cancer vaccines**: Breaking tolerance to tumor antigens (opposite goal)
- **Autoimmune therapy**: Restoring tolerance to self-antigens
