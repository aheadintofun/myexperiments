# Tumor Immune Evasion

## Definition
Mechanisms by which cancer cells escape immune surveillance and destruction, despite being recognized as "altered self." This is **boundary failure outward**—non-self (genetically aberrant cancer) evades classification as foreign, allowing phenotypic boundary violation.

## The Immunosurveillance Hypothesis

Cancer cells are continuously generated but normally eliminated:
1. **Oncogenic mutations** create abnormal proteins (neoantigens)
2. **Immune recognition**: Neoantigens presented on MHC I
3. **Cytotoxic T cell killing**: CD8+ T cells destroy cancer cells
4. **Elimination**: Tumor prevented before clinical detection

Most cancers we see have **evaded this process**—they are the escapees.

## Three Phases: Immunoediting

### 1. Elimination (Immunosurveillance)
Immune system successfully eliminates early cancer cells:
- Neoantigens trigger T cell responses
- NK cells recognize "missing self" (MHC I downregulation)
- Inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ) induce apoptosis
- **Outcome**: No tumor

### 2. Equilibrium (Darwinian Selection)
Immune pressure selects for less immunogenic variants:
- Immune system controls but doesn't eliminate tumor
- **Selection pressure**: Immunogenic cells killed, evasive cells survive
- Tumor enters **dormancy** (can persist for years)
- **Outcome**: Stalemate

### 3. Escape (Evasion)
Cancer cells acquire mutations enabling immune evasion:
- **Immunoresistant variants** dominate population
- Active suppression of immune responses
- **Outcome**: Clinical cancer

## Mechanisms of Evasion

### Antigen Presentation Defects
**MHC I downregulation**:
- Mutations in HLA genes, β2-microglobulin, TAP transporters
- **Effect**: Neoantigens not presented, T cells don't recognize cancer
- **Counterdefense**: NK cells recognize MHC I loss (but can also be evaded)

**Antigen loss**:
- Loss of neoantigen-encoding genes (deletion, LOH)
- Immunoediting: Selective pressure eliminates immunogenic clones

### Immunosuppressive Microenvironment
Tumors recruit suppressive cells:
- **Tregs**: Suppress anti-tumor T cells
- **Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)**: Block T cell activation
- **Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)**: M2 phenotype, pro-tumorigenic

Tumors secrete immunosuppressive cytokines:
- **TGF-β**: Inhibits T cell function, induces Tregs
- **IL-10**: Suppresses APC function
- **VEGF**: Inhibits dendritic cell maturation

### Checkpoint Upregulation
Cancer cells express immune checkpoint ligands:
- **PD-L1**: Binds PD-1 on T cells → exhaustion, apoptosis
- **CTLA-4 ligands (B7)**: Compete with CD28 for costimulation
- **TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT**: Additional exhaustion pathways

**Effect**: "Don't eat me" signals to immune cells

### Metabolic Competition
Tumors deplete nutrients required by T cells:
- **Glucose depletion**: T cells starved in tumor microenvironment
- **Oxygen depletion (hypoxia)**: Impairs T cell effector function
- **Tryptophan depletion**: IDO enzyme degrades tryptophan, inhibits T cells
- **Lactic acid accumulation**: Acidic environment suppresses immunity

### Fas Ligand Expression
Cancer cells express FasL:
- Binds Fas on T cells
- Induces T cell apoptosis
- **Reversal**: Tumor kills immune cells ("counterattack")

## Immunotherapy Strategies

### Checkpoint Blockade
Release brakes on immune system:
- **Anti-PD-1** (nivolumab, pembrolizumab): Block T cell exhaustion
- **Anti-CTLA-4** (ipilimumab): Enhance T cell activation
- **Combination therapy**: Synergistic effects

**Success**: Durable responses in melanoma, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma
**Limitation**: Only ~20-40% response rate (most tumors still evade)

### CAR-T Therapy
Engineer T cells with chimeric antigen receptors:
- **Target**: Tumor surface antigens (CD19 for B cell malignancies)
- **Bypass MHC**: Receptor directly binds antigen (no presentation needed)
- **Success**: Dramatic responses in liquid tumors (ALL, lymphoma)
- **Challenge**: Solid tumors resistant (microenvironment, antigen heterogeneity)

### Cancer Vaccines
Train immune system to recognize tumor antigens:
- **Personalized neoantigens**: Sequence tumor, synthesize neoantigen peptides
- **Dendritic cell vaccines**: Load patient DCs with tumor antigens, re-infuse

### Oncolytic Viruses
Viruses that selectively infect/kill cancer cells:
- **T-VEC** (talimogene laherparepvec): Modified herpes virus for melanoma
- **Mechanism**: Direct lysis + inflammatory response attracts immune cells

## Tumor Heterogeneity and Immune Evasion

Tumors are **polyclonal**:
- Subclones with different neoantigen profiles
- **Single-target therapy**: Eliminates sensitive clones, resistant clones expand
- **Solution**: Multi-antigen targeting, combination therapy

Immune evasion is a **moving target**—the tumor population evolves under treatment.

## Boundary Perspective

Tumor immune evasion is **phenotypic boundary camouflage**:
- Cancer is genetically non-self (mutations)
- But cancer suppresses recognition signals
- Immune system fails to classify as "foreign"
- **Result**: Tumor grows within phenotypic boundary without triggering defense

This is **adversarial attack** on the immune classifier.
