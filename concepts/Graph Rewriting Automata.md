# Graph Rewriting Automata

## Definition
An extension of cellular automata to **dynamic graph structures** where both node states AND topology evolve simultaneously via local rewriting rules. Unlike cellular automata with fixed lattices, GRA allow the network structure itself to change over time.

## Mathematical Formulation
GRA state: $G = \{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{S}\}$
- $\mathcal{A}$: Adjacency matrix (topology)
- $\mathcal{S}$: State vector (node properties)

Both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ evolve according to local rules depending on vertex state and neighborhood configuration.

## Key Extension from Cellular Automata
Standard [[Cellular Automata Framework]]:
- Fixed lattice topology
- State evolves, structure frozen

Graph Rewriting Automata:
- **Dynamic topology** - graph structure evolves
- **Topology-behavior coupling** - nodes' behavior constrained by structure; structure generated by behavior
- See [[Dynamic Graph Topology]] for detailed mechanism

## Fundamental Operations

### Vertex Division
Primary growth operation: vertex $v \to$ complete subgraph $K_n$
- Parent vertex divides into multiple daughter vertices
- Daughters inherit parent's connections
- Biological analog: [[Cell Division as Vertex Division]]

### Local Rewriting Rules
- Defined over [[Local Configuration Space]]
- Vertex state + neighborhood → next state + topology change
- Rules are purely local (no global controller)
- See [[Rule Space and Numbering]]

## Emergence
From simple local rules emerge:
- [[Organic Structure Emergence]] - biological-looking morphologies
- [[Self-Organization in Graphs]] - complex global patterns
- [[Topology-Behavior Coupling]] - feedback loop driving pattern formation

Some rules produce chaotic unbounded growth; others generate structured, self-similar forms reminiscent of biological tissues.

## Biological Applications
- [[Morphogenesis as Graph Rewriting]] - tissue development as iterative graph transformation
- [[Cell Division as Vertex Division]] - mitosis in network formalism
- [[Growth Dynamics in Networks]] - vasculature, neural networks, bacterial colonies
- [[Tissue Topology]] - cells as vertices, adhesions as edges

## Contrast with Other Frameworks
- [[Cellular Automata Framework]] - Fixed topology, simpler
- [[Graph Cellular Automata]] - Arbitrary static graphs, states evolve
- **GRA** - Arbitrary dynamic graphs, topology AND states co-evolve
