# Graph Rewriting Automata

## Definition
An extension of [[Cellular Automata Framework|cellular automata]] to **dynamic graph structures** where both node states AND [[Network Topology|topology]] evolve simultaneously via [[Local Interaction|local rewriting rules]]. Unlike [[Cellular Automata Framework|cellular automata]] with fixed lattices, GRA allow the [[Network Topology|network structure]] itself to change over time.

## Mathematical Formulation
GRA state: $G = \{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{S}\}$
- $\mathcal{A}$: Adjacency matrix ([[Network Topology|topology]])
- $\mathcal{S}$: [[State Space|State vector]] (node properties)

Both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ evolve according to [[Local Interaction|local rules]] depending on [[Vertex Division|vertex]] state and [[Local Configuration Space|neighborhood configuration]].

## Key Extension from Cellular Automata
Standard [[Cellular Automata Framework]]:
- Fixed lattice topology
- State evolves, structure frozen

Graph Rewriting Automata:
- **[[Dynamic Graph Topology|Dynamic topology]]** - [[Network Topology|graph structure]] evolves
- **[[Topology-Behavior Coupling]]** - nodes' behavior constrained by structure; structure generated by behavior
- See [[Dynamic Graph Topology]] for detailed mechanism

## Fundamental Operations

### Vertex Division
Primary [[Growth Dynamics in Networks|growth]] operation: [[Vertex Division|vertex]] $v \to$ complete subgraph $K_n$
- Parent [[Vertex Division|vertex]] divides into multiple daughter vertices
- Daughters inherit parent's connections
- Biological analog: [[Cell Division as Vertex Division]]

### Local Rewriting Rules
- Defined over [[Local Configuration Space]]
- Vertex state + neighborhood → next state + topology change
- Rules are purely local (no global controller)
- See [[Rule Space and Numbering]]

## Emergence
From simple [[Local Interaction|local rules]] emerge:
- [[Organic Structure Emergence]] - biological-looking [[Morphogenesis|morphologies]]
- [[Self-Organization in Graphs]] - complex [[Emergent Global Pattern|global patterns]]
- [[Topology-Behavior Coupling]] - feedback loop driving [[Turing Pattern Formation|pattern formation]]

Some rules produce [[Chaotic vs Ordered Growth|chaotic unbounded growth]]; others generate structured, [[Hierarchical Composition|self-similar forms]] reminiscent of [[Tissue Topology|biological tissues]].

## Biological Applications
- [[Morphogenesis as Graph Rewriting]] - tissue development as iterative graph transformation
- [[Cell Division as Vertex Division]] - mitosis in network formalism
- [[Growth Dynamics in Networks]] - vasculature, neural networks, bacterial colonies
- [[Tissue Topology]] - cells as vertices, adhesions as edges

## Contrast with Other Frameworks
- [[Cellular Automata Framework]] - Fixed topology, simpler
- [[Graph Cellular Automata]] - Arbitrary static graphs, states evolve
- **GRA** - Arbitrary dynamic graphs, topology AND states co-evolve
