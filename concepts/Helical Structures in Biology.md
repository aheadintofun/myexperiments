# Helical Structures in Biology

Biology is saturated with helices: DNA, α-helices, collagen, bacterial flagella, microtubules, cochlear structure. This is not coincidence. Helices may be geodesics in constrained [[State Space|configuration spaces]]—and possibly echoes of deeper [[Symmetry Breaking in Biological Systems|geometric structure]].

## The Ubiquity of Helices

| Structure | Pitch | Radius | Handedness | Function |
|-----------|-------|--------|------------|----------|
| **DNA (B-form)** | 3.4 nm / 10.5 bp | 1.0 nm | Right | Information storage |
| **α-helix** | 0.54 nm / 3.6 residues | 0.23 nm | Right | Protein secondary structure |
| **Collagen** | 0.96 nm / 3.3 residues | — | Left (triple-right) | Structural fiber |
| **Bacterial flagellum** | ~2.5 μm | ~0.2 μm | Left/Right | Motility |
| **Microtubule** | 12 nm / 13 protofilaments | 12.5 nm | Left | Cytoskeleton, transport |

The prevalence of right-handed helices is striking. Is there a geometric reason?

## Helices as Geodesics

A helix on a cylinder is a geodesic—the shortest path between two points at different heights. But real biological helices don't live on cylinders. They live in high-dimensional [[State Space|configuration spaces]] constrained by:

- Bond angles and lengths (covalent geometry)
- Steric exclusion (atoms can't overlap)
- Hydrogen bonding (stabilizing interactions)
- Hydrophobic/hydrophilic patterning ([[Microenvironment Context|environment]])

The helix is what emerges when you find the geodesic on this [[Constrained Dynamics|constraint manifold]]. See [[DNA Double Helix as Geodesic]] for the detailed treatment.

## The Octonionic Speculation

What if biological helices are not just geodesics on molecular constraint manifolds, but shadows of geodesics on $S^7$—the 7-sphere of unit octonions?

### The Hopf Fibration

The quaternionic Hopf fibration:
$$S^3 \hookrightarrow S^7 \xrightarrow{\pi} S^4$$

fibers $S^7$ as $S^3$ (3-sphere) circles over $S^4$ (4-sphere base). A geodesic on $S^7$ that spirals around the $S^3$ fibers while moving along $S^4$ projects to a **helix-like structure** in lower dimensions.

### The Associator as Twist

In the ALT framework, the **associator** $[A,B,C] = (AB)C - A(BC)$ measures non-associativity—the failure of grouping to commute. For octonions, this is non-zero and generates curvature.

**Speculation**: The *twist* of a biological helix (the angle per unit length) could be related to the associator magnitude. Regions of high "associative strain" would naturally coil.

$$\text{twist} \sim \|[A,B,C]\| / \text{length}$$

The ~36°/bp twist in B-DNA and the ~100°/residue in α-helices might encode something about octonionic geometry projected to 3D.

### G₂ and Handedness

$G_2 = \text{Aut}(\mathbb{O})$ is the 14-dimensional automorphism group of octonions. It preserves the associative 3-form $\varphi$ on 7-manifolds with $G_2$ structure.

**Speculation**: The predominance of right-handed helices in biology could reflect a **chirality in the G₂ structure**—a preferred orientation of the associative 3-form. Just as parity violation in weak interactions breaks left-right symmetry, biological handedness might trace to the geometry of $S^7$.

### The 7 and 8

Suggestive numerology (treat with appropriate skepticism):
- DNA has **4 bases** (dimension of quaternions ℍ)
- Organized into codons of **3** (points on a Fano line)
- The genetic code has **64 = 8²** codons (dimension of 𝕆 squared)
- Amino acids: **20** standard (close to 21 = 7×3, points × lines on Fano plane)

This may be coincidence. But the ALT framework suggests dimensional relationships between algebras encode physics; perhaps they also constrain chemistry.

## Helices and Information

All major biological [[Information Compression in Biology|information]] carriers are helical:
- DNA ([[Information Compression in Biology|genetic information]])
- mRNA (transcribed information)
- α-helices in transcription factors (regulatory information)
- Collagen (structural information for ECM)

If helices are geodesics—minimal paths through [[Constrained Dynamics|constraint space]]—then **[[Information Compression in Biology|information storage]] selects for geodesic geometry**. The helix is the most efficient encoding architecture.

This connects to [[Information Compression in Biology]]: the helix compresses the [[Constrained Dynamics|constraint satisfaction problem]] into a repeating, [[Hierarchical Composition|self-similar structure]].

## Open Questions

1. **Can the specific geometry of B-DNA (10.5 bp/turn, 3.4 nm pitch) be derived from octonionic constraints?**
2. **Is there a $G_2$-invariant action whose ground state is helical?**
3. **Do the torsion classes of $G_2$-structures (Fernandez-Gray classification) map to different helix types?**
4. **Why are biological helices predominantly right-handed?**
