# Moonlighting Proteins

## Definition
Proteins that perform multiple **unrelated** functions using the same polypeptide chain, without gene fusion, alternative splicing, or proteolytic processing. The same protein structure, in different cellular contexts, performs categorically different biological roles.

## Key Examples

### Crystallins
Lens proteins providing structural transparency that moonlight as metabolic enzymes:
- τ-crystallin = α-enolase (glycolysis)
- ζ-crystallin = NADPH:quinone reductase
- Same polypeptide serves optical function + enzymatic catalysis

### Phosphoglucose Isomerase (PGI)
- **Intracellular**: Glycolytic enzyme (glucose-6-phosphate ↔ fructose-6-phosphate)
- **Extracellular**: Autocrine motility factor, neuroleukin, maturation factor
- Context (inside/outside cell) determines function

### GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
- **Cytoplasmic tetramer**: Glycolysis enzyme
- **Nuclear monomer**: Transcription regulation, RNA transport, apoptosis
- **Surface receptor**: Binds transferrin, promotes endocytosis
- Oligomeric state + localization determine function

### Heat Shock Proteins
- **Intracellular**: Chaperones preventing protein misfolding
- **Extracellular**: Signaling molecules, immune activation
- Secretion pathway bypasses normal export mechanisms

## Functional Basis
Moonlighting arises from proteins having **multiple functional sites**:
- Active site performs catalysis
- Surface patches enable protein-protein binding
- Different partners recruited in different contexts

## Prevalence
Over 500 confirmed moonlighting proteins across all domains of life. Likely underestimated—systematic detection is difficult.

## Connection to Equidecomposability
The same structural "pieces" (domains, motifs, surface patches) are "rearranged" contextually for different functions. Not physical rearrangement, but **functional redeployment** of the same geometric arrangement in different environments.

## Evolutionary Implications
Moonlighting provides **preadaptation**: hidden functions can become primary under new selection pressure. Creates evolutionary capacitance—latent functional diversity.
