# Unicellular to Multicellular Transition

## Definition
The emergence of organisms composed of multiple cooperating cells that remain together, differentiate, and exhibit division of labor. Evolved independently **20+ times** across life. Date: ~600 million years ago (animals), ~450 Mya (land plants), multiple times in algae, fungi.

## What Changed (Abstract)

### Before: Unicellular
- Each cell is an independent organism
- Cell division = reproduction
- Individual selection only

### After: Multicellular
- Cells remain attached post-division
- Cells differentiate (same genome, different functions)
- Group selection operates
- Organism > cell

**Abstraction**: **Individual → collective**, **competition → cooperation**.

## The Cooperation Problem
Multicellularity requires cells to **cooperate** rather than compete. But evolution favors **selfish replicators**. How is cooperation stable?

### The Defection Threat
In any cooperative group, **cheaters** can invade:
- Cheat: Don't contribute to group function, but reap benefits
- **Example**: Cancer cells (defect from multicellular cooperation)

**Challenge**: Prevent cheaters from disrupting cooperation.

## Mechanisms Enforcing Cooperation

### 1. Clonal Development
- Multicellular organism starts from **single cell** (zygote)
- All cells genetically identical (clones)
- **Consequence**: Helping clone-mates = helping own genes (kin selection)

**Abstraction**: **Shared genetic interest** aligns individual and group fitness.

### 2. Germline Sequestration
- **Soma**: Body cells (differentiated, non-reproductive)
- **Germline**: Reproductive cells (eggs, sperm)
- **Key**: Only germline passes genes to next generation

**Consequence**: Somatic cells have **zero reproductive potential**—no incentive to cheat.

**Weismann barrier**: Separation of soma and germline (animals, plants).

### 3. Policing Mechanisms
- **Apoptosis**: Damaged/aberrant cells self-destruct
- **Immune surveillance**: Eliminate abnormal cells (cancer precursors)
- **Cell cycle checkpoints**: Prevent uncontrolled proliferation

**Abstraction**: **Quality control** (see [[Quality Control in Living Systems]]).

### 4. Division of Labor
- Cells specialize: Muscle, neuron, liver, etc.
- Specialization increases **interdependence**
- **Consequence**: Cheating less viable (specialized cells can't survive alone)

## Evolutionary Steps

### Stage 1: Aggregation
Cells remain together after division (don't disperse).
- **Example**: Colonial algae (Volvox)
- **Advantage**: Larger size (avoid predation)

### Stage 2: Communication
Cells signal to coordinate behavior.
- **Example**: Quorum sensing (bacteria), pheromones (slime molds)
- **Consequence**: Collective decision-making

### Stage 3: Differentiation
Cells adopt different fates (same genome, different expression).
- **Example**: Dictyostelium (slime mold): stalk cells vs. spore cells
- **Soma-germline split**: Key innovation

### Stage 4: Integration
Multicellular organism functions as **individual**.
- **Organs**: Specialized tissues cooperate
- **Developmental program**: Embryogenesis (zygote → adult)
- **Example**: Animals, plants, fungi

## Examples of Multicellularity

### Animals (Metazoa)
- ~600-800 Mya
- **Key innovations**: Hox genes, Wnt/Notch signaling, extracellular matrix (collagen)
- **Complexity**: Nervous system, organs, complex development

### Land Plants
- ~450 Mya
- **Key innovations**: Cellulose cell walls, chloroplasts, alternation of generations
- **Complexity**: Vascular systems, roots, leaves, flowers

### Fungi
- ~600 Mya
- **Hyphae**: Filamentous growth (septate or coenocytic)
- **Fruiting bodies**: Mushrooms (reproductive structures)

### Green Algae (Volvox)
- **Simple multicellularity**: 500-50,000 cells
- **Soma-germline split**: Somatic cells (flagellated) vs. reproductive cells (gonidia)

### Slime Molds (Dictyostelium)
- **Facultative multicellularity**: Unicellular when food abundant, aggregate when starved
- **Altruism**: ~20% cells become sterile stalk, support spores

## Evolutionary Advantages

### Size
- Larger size → avoid predation
- Access new niches (plants colonize land)

### Division of Labor
- Specialization increases efficiency
- **Example**: Photosynthetic cells vs. structural cells (plants)

### Complexity
- Organs, nervous systems, behaviors
- Multicellularity enables **emergent functions** impossible for single cells

## Why Multiple Origins?
Multicellularity evolved 20+ times. Why?

**Answer**: **Strong selective advantage** + **eukaryotic toolkit made it accessible**.

- Eukaryotes have cell adhesion molecules, differentiation machinery, complex signaling
- Transition is **evolutionarily easy** once eukaryotic complexity exists

## Connection to Cooperation Theory
See [[Multicellularity as Cooperation]]: Evolutionary game theory.

- **Prisoner's dilemma**: Cooperate or defect?
- **Solution**: Kin selection, repeated interactions, policing

Multicellularity is **evolutionary stable strategy** (ESS) when:
- $b/c > 1/r$ (Hamilton's rule: benefit-to-cost ratio > inverse relatedness)
- Policing mechanisms present
