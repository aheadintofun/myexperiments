# Evolutionary Tinkering

## Definition
François Jacob's concept of evolution as **bricolage** (French: "tinkering")—working with available materials rather than designing from scratch. Evolution repurposes, recombines, and modifies existing structures opportunistically, constrained by phylogenetic history.

## Key Principles

### Work with What's Available
Evolution cannot create *de novo*—must modify existing structures:
- **No blank slate**: All innovations built on ancestral scaffolds
- **Path dependence**: Historical contingency shapes possibilities
- **Local optimization**: Improvements from current state, not global redesign

### Opportunistic Reuse
Structures evolved for one function co-opted for others:
- **Exaptation**: Feathers for insulation → flight
- **Moonlighting**: Crystallins (enzymes → lens proteins)
- **Domain shuffling**: Recombine existing domains for new proteins

### Incremental Modification
Small, viable steps—no saltation:
- **Gradual refinement**: Successive improvements
- **Intermediate forms viable**: Each step must be functional
- **Neutral drift**: Non-adaptive changes accumulate, later co-opted

## Tinkerer's Toolkit in Proteins

### The "Parts Bin": Protein Domains
~10,000 domain families serve as reusable modules:
- **Kinase domain**: Appears in hundreds of proteins
- **Immunoglobulin domain**: Antibodies, cell adhesion, receptor ectodomains
- **Leucine-rich repeat**: Pattern recognition, protein-protein interaction
- Same parts, endless combinations

### Assembly Mechanisms
- **Exon shuffling**: DNA-level recombination at domain boundaries
- **Gene duplication**: Copy enables divergence without loss of original
- **Insertions/deletions**: Add/remove domains or linkers
- **Point mutations**: Fine-tune existing functions

### Functional Redeployment
- **Promiscuous activities**: Weak side reactions become primary after duplication
- **Binding site repurposing**: Ancestral substrate pocket accepts new ligands
- **Regulatory co-option**: Existing genes under new promoters

## Contrast with Engineering Design

| **Engineering** | **Tinkering** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Design from first principles | Build on what exists |
| Optimize globally | Optimize locally |
| Specialized components | Multifunctional parts |
| Clean modularity | Messy interdependence |
| Plan then build | Build then modify |

## Examples in Protein Evolution

### Crystallins
- Ancestral enzymes (enolase, quinone reductase)
- High expression in lens for structural role
- Retained enzymatic activity (moonlighting)
- **Tinkering**: Didn't evolve new transparent proteins, repurposed abundant enzymes

### Vertebrate Adaptive Immunity
- V(D)J recombination from transposase enzyme
- Antibodies built from immunoglobulin domain repeats
- **Tinkering**: Co-opted DNA recombination machinery for somatic diversification

### Antifreeze Proteins
- Evolved independently in fish, insects, plants
- From diverse ancestors: proteases, lectins, apolipoproteins
- **Tinkering**: Whatever protein available, modify to bind ice crystals

### Snake Venoms
- Recruited from digestive enzymes, nerve growth factors, blood proteins
- Gene duplication + neofunctionalization
- **Tinkering**: Existing proteins repurposed for prey immobilization

## Implications for Protein Equidecomposability
Tinkering **is** protein equidecomposability in action:
- Evolution "dissects" existing proteins (domains, motifs)
- "Rearranges" pieces into new architectures
- Same structural components, new functional outputs

## Constraints on Tinkering

### Phylogenetic Constraints
Cannot undo deep history:
- **Vertebrates**: Cannot switch from endoskeleton to exoskeleton
- **DNA/RNA**: Cannot switch genetic code radically

### Functional Constraints
Changes must maintain viability:
- **Embryonic lethality**: Radical changes often fatal
- **Essential genes**: Limited capacity for variation
- **Epistatic interactions**: Changes must be compatible with genetic background

### Structural Constraints
Protein stability/folding limits:
- **Hydrophobic core**: Cannot tolerate many charged residues
- **Active site geometry**: Catalysis requires precise positioning
- **Domain interfaces**: Oligomerization requires complementarity

## Evolutionary Outcomes
Tinkering produces:
- **Exquisite complexity**: Rube Goldberg machines that work
- **Suboptimal design**: Good enough, not perfect (recurrent laryngeal nerve)
- **Functional diversity**: Same scaffolds, endless variations
- **Phylogenetic signal**: Homology reveals shared ancestry
