# Symmetry Breaking in Biological Systems

## Definition
The spontaneous emergence of asymmetric patterns from initially symmetric conditions. In biological lattices with symmetric update rules, instabilities can break symmetry to produce spatial or functional patterns—morphogenesis, social segregation, ecosystem fragmentation.

## Mechanism
- Uniform initial conditions on lattice
- Symmetric local update rules
- Small perturbations amplified through positive feedback
- System settles into asymmetric stable state

## Examples Across Scales

### Developmental Biology
- **Turing patterns**: Reaction-diffusion creates stripes, spots from homogeneous tissue
- **Morphogenesis**: Identical cells differentiate into distinct tissue types
- **Left-right asymmetry**: Bilateral organisms break mirror symmetry

### Ecology
- **Ecosystem fragmentation**: Homogeneous habitat → patchy distribution
- **Schelling segregation model**: Mixed population → spatial clustering by type
- **Vegetation patterns**: Uniform landscape → banded or spotted vegetation

### Disease
- **Tumor initiation**: Single cell breaks homeostatic symmetry
- **Cachexia**: Balanced anabolism/catabolism → unidirectional catabolism

## Phase Transitions
Symmetry breaking often occurs at critical thresholds:
- **Percolation thresholds**: Connectivity suddenly spanning system
- **Epidemic thresholds**: Subcritical vs supercritical transmission
- **Tipping points**: Small parameter change → qualitative state shift

## Lattice Framework Connection
The lattice structure enables symmetry breaking through:
- Local interactions with global consequences
- Positive feedback amplifying fluctuations
- Geometric constraints channeling pattern formation
