# Hormesis

## Definition
A biphasic [[Dose-Response Relationship|dose-response]] phenomenon where low doses of a stressor produce beneficial effects while high doses are harmful. The organism responds to controlled stress by enhancing its [[Functional Capacity|functional capacity]] beyond baseline—a paradoxical improvement through challenge.

## Examples

### Exercise
- Acute stress: Muscle damage, metabolic perturbation
- Response: Enhanced muscle synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, improved capacity
- Chronic benefit: Increased strength, endurance, metabolic health

### Caloric Restriction / Fasting
- Acute stress: Nutrient deprivation
- Response: [[Bioinformatics/Concepts/Autophagy]], stress resistance pathways, metabolic flexibility
- Chronic benefit: Extended healthspan, improved insulin sensitivity

### Heat/Cold Exposure
- Acute stress: Temperature challenge
- Response: Heat shock proteins, brown fat activation
- Chronic benefit: Improved thermoregulation, stress resilience

### Phytochemicals
- Acute stress: Mild toxins from plants
- Response: Upregulation of detoxification enzymes, antioxidants
- Chronic benefit: Reduced oxidative damage, cancer protection

### Dry Needling / Acupuncture
- Acute stress: Controlled micro-trauma to trigger points, fascia, muscle
- Response: Local inflammatory cascade, increased blood flow, neuromuscular reset
- Chronic benefit: Reduced chronic pain, improved tissue quality, restored movement patterns
- Note: The needle itself does minimal damage—the therapeutic effect comes from the *adaptive response* to perceived injury

## Mechanism: Overcompensation
1. Stressor causes controlled damage
2. [[Adaptive Response|Adaptive response]] triggered
3. System overcompensates—builds back stronger
4. Net result: Enhanced [[Functional Capacity|capacity]]

This is **[[Selective Catabolism|selective catabolism]] → enhanced anabolism** in action.

## Lattice Framework Interpretation
Hormetic stress induces a controlled [[Equidecomposability|dissection-reassembly]] cycle:
- [[Heterogeneous Lattice|Lattice]] partially disassembles ([[Selective Catabolism|selective catabolism]])
- Resources reallocated
- [[Heterogeneous Lattice|Lattice]] reassembles with improved configuration
- [[Quality Control in Living Systems|Quality metric]] increases with each cycle
