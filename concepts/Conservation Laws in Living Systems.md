# Conservation Laws in Living Systems

## Definition
Quantities that remain constant during biological transformations, analogous to conservation laws in physics (energy, momentum, mass). In biology, these are **accounting principles** that constrain possible transformations.

## Core Principle
**What's preserved during reorganization?**

Understanding conservation laws enables:
- Predicting allowed vs. forbidden transitions
- Tracking matter/energy flows
- Designing therapeutic interventions (see [[Cachexia Inversion]])

## Conservation in Physics (Background)
- **Energy**: Total energy constant (1st law of thermodynamics)
- **Mass**: Mass-energy conserved (including $E=mc^2$)
- **Momentum**: Total momentum conserved in isolated systems
- **Charge**: Electric charge conserved

Biology inherits these but adds new quantities.

## Biological Conservation Quantities

### Mass/Atoms
- **Total nitrogen**: Conserved during protein degradation/synthesis
- **Carbon balance**: Total carbon tracked through metabolic pathways
- **Water balance**: Total body water (renal regulation)

### Energy
- **ATP accounting**: Energy currency, production/consumption balanced
- **Thermodynamics**: Free energy decreases (2nd law), but local energy gradients maintained

### Stoichiometry
- **Redox balance**: Electrons transferred in oxidation must equal electrons accepted in reduction
- **Elemental composition**: C:N:P ratios (Redfield ratio in marine ecosystems)

### Genetic Information
- **DNA base pairs**: Total genome size approximately conserved (barring mutations, duplications)
- **Allele frequency**: Population genetics (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium under specific conditions)

### Cell Number (Approximately)
- **Steady-state organs**: Proliferation = apoptosis (homeostasis)
- **Developmental compartments**: Fixed cell counts (Drosophila imaginal discs)

## Equidecomposability Connection
[[Equidecomposability]]: Geometric transformations preserving conserved quantities.

**Example**: Muscle wasting in [[Cachexia as Phase Transition]]:
- **Conserved**: Total body nitrogen (short term)
- **Not conserved**: Muscle mass, functional capacity

Nitrogen redistributed from muscle to inflammatory proteins. Conservation law satisfied, but **quality degraded** (see [[Functional Capacity]]).

## Violation of "Conservation"
Some quantities appear conserved but aren't:

### Total Body Mass
- **Appears conserved**: Short timescales (hours-days)
- **Not conserved**: Gains/losses via eating, excretion, respiration

### Cell Count
- **Appears conserved**: Steady-state tissues
- **Not conserved**: Cancer (uncontrolled proliferation), aging (cell loss)

### Epigenetic State
- **Appears conserved**: Cell divisions preserve methylation patterns
- **Not conserved**: Reprogramming, environmental influence

## Therapeutic Implications

### Cachexia Inversion
[[Cachexia Inversion]] requires understanding conservation:
- **Not enough**: Add total nitrogen/calories
- **Required**: Rebuild functional muscle tissue architecture (see [[Dissection Quality Score]])

Conservation of quantity ≠ conservation of quality.

### Metabolic Engineering
Redirecting metabolic flux:
- Identify conserved metabolites
- Engineer pathways respecting stoichiometry
- Redirect carbon flow while balancing redox

## Computational Perspective
[[Equidecomposability]] as formal framework:
- Define conserved quantities (mass, charge, stoichiometry)
- Biological transformations must respect conservation
- [[Dissection Quality Score]]: Evaluate quality of transformations satisfying conservation

## Limits of Conservation
Living systems are **open thermodynamic systems**:
- Exchange matter, energy with environment
- Entropy locally decreases (order increases) at cost of environmental entropy increase
- Conservation laws hold for **closed** subsystems or over appropriate timescales

## Related Concepts

- [[Dissection Quality Score]] - Quality of configurations with same conserved quantities
- [[Functional Capacity]] - Conservation of quantity ≠ conservation of function
- [[Cachexia Inversion]] - Therapeutic transformation respecting conservation
