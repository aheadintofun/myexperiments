# Hierarchical Composition

## Definition
Biology exhibits **scale-free recursive structure** where similar organizational principles apply at each level. The hierarchy spans: molecule → complex → organelle → cell → tissue → organ → organism → population → ecosystem.

## Key Principle
At every level, the same structural motifs recur:
- **Modularity**: Protein domains, gene regulatory modules, tissue compartments, breeding populations
- **Compartmentalization**: Selective transport across boundaries
- **Emergent properties**: Behavior not predictable from components alone
- **Composition rules**: How lower-level units combine

## Nested Algebra Structure
Biology is a **nested algebra** where similar operations apply at different substrates:
- Protein-protein binding ≈ cell-cell adhesion ≈ organism-organism social bonding
- Enzyme catalysis ≈ cell signaling ≈ ecosystem trophic cascades
- Gene regulation ≈ endocrine control ≈ population dynamics

The **form** is conserved; the **substrate** changes.

## Examples Across Scales

### Molecular Level
- Amino acids → peptides → proteins → complexes
- Modular domains recombine
- Allostery as compositional logic

### Cellular Level
- Organelles as functional modules
- Signaling cascades as compositional circuits
- Cells as units in tissues

### Tissue/Organ Level
- Tissue compartments (crypts, lobules, nephrons)
- Functional units repeat spatially
- Emergent organ-level physiology

### Organism/Population Level
- Organisms as nodes in ecological networks
- Population structure (demes, metapopulations)
- Ecosystem modules (guilds, trophic levels)

## Computational Implication
A universal biological computational framework should represent this **hierarchical compositionality** natively—not as separate tools for each scale, but as recursive application of the same algebraic operations.
