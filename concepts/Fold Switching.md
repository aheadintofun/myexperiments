# Fold Switching

## Definition
The ability of a single amino acid sequence to adopt multiple, distinct secondary and tertiary structures, each with different functions. Challenges the "one sequence → one structure → one function" central dogma of protein science.

## Structural Plasticity
Same linear sequence, different 3D folds:
- **α-helix** ↔ **β-sheet** transitions
- **Ordered** ↔ **disordered** states
- **Compact** ↔ **extended** conformations

No covalent modifications (PTMs, proteolysis) required—purely conformational.

## Key Examples

### RfaH Transcription Factor
- **Free state**: α-helical C-terminal domain (autoinhibited)
- **RNA polymerase-bound**: β-barrel C-terminal domain (active)
- Complete secondary structure refolding upon binding

### Mad2 Checkpoint Protein
- **Inactive**: "open" conformation
- **Active**: "closed" conformation
- Fold switch regulates cell cycle progression

### Lymphotactin
- **Monomer**: All-β chemokine fold (canonical receptor binding)
- **Dimer**: All-α structure (glycosaminoglycan binding)
- Temperature/salt-dependent equilibrium

## Mechanistic Basis
Fold switching enabled by:
- **Intrinsic disorder**: Regions lacking stable structure
- **Marginal stability**: Small energy differences between folds
- **Environmental triggers**: pH, temperature, ionic strength, binding partners

## Functional Consequences
Different folds perform different biochemical functions:
- **Enzymatic activity** (active site geometry changes)
- **Binding specificity** (surface topology changes)
- **Localization** (exposed/buried localization signals)
- **Oligomerization** (interface formation/disruption)

## Evolutionary Context
Fold switching may represent **evolutionary intermediates**:
- Proteins "deciding" between alternative stable states
- Selection can then fix one fold or maintain bistability
- Provides raw material for functional divergence

## Detection Challenges
Hard to observe systematically:
- Transient conformations difficult to trap
- Standard structure determination assumes single fold
- Computational predictions assume fold uniqueness

Likely **underestimated prevalence** due to experimental bias.

## Connection to Equidecomposability
Same structural "pieces" (helices, sheets, loops) rearranged into different topologies. Like hinged dissections: same pieces, different spatial configurations.
