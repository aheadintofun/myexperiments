# Hinged Dissection

## Definition
A geometric dissection where pieces remain connected by hinges and can swing continuously from one shape configuration to another. Unlike standard dissections requiring separate rearrangement, hinged dissections provide continuous transformation paths.

## Mathematical Structure
Pieces are connected at vertices and edges, forming a chain or tree structure that can reconfigure through rotation while maintaining connectivity.

## Biological Significance
Hinged dissections represent **continuous trajectories through shape space**:
- **Morphogenesis**: Developmental transformation from one body plan to another
- **Disease progression**: Continuous path through state space
- **Conformational change**: Protein folding, allosteric transitions

## Difference from Standard Dissection
- Standard dissection: Discrete rearrangement of independent pieces
- Hinged dissection: Continuous motion along a trajectory
- Additional constraint: Connectivity must be preserved

## Dynamical Interpretation
A hinged dissection is a _dynamical path on a branching landscape_ represented in geometric form. The hinges constrain which trajectories are physically accessible.
