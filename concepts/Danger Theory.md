# Danger Theory

## Definition
Polly Matzinger's alternative to the self-nonself model: The immune system responds to **danger signals** (tissue damage, stress, cellular distress) rather than foreignness per se. What matters is not whether a molecule is non-self, but whether it signals damage or dysfunction.

## Core Insight

Traditional view (Burnet):
- Self = tolerated
- Non-self = attacked

Danger model (Matzinger):
- **Safe** = tolerated (self AND harmless non-self)
- **Dangerous** = attacked (damaged self AND harmful non-self)

This explains paradoxes the self-nonself model struggles with:
- **Commensal bacteria**: Non-self but tolerated (safe)
- **Fetus**: Non-self but tolerated (safe, sends suppressive signals)
- **Tumors**: Self but attacked (dangerous, sends stress signals)
- **Transplants**: Non-self, dangerous (damage from surgery triggers inflammation)

## Danger Signals

### DAMPs (Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns)
Endogenous molecules released by stressed/dying cells:
- **HMGB1**: Nuclear protein (chromatin binding)
- **ATP**: Extracellular ATP signals cell death
- **Uric acid**: Released by dying cells
- **Heat shock proteins**: Stress-induced chaperones
- **DNA/RNA**: Nucleic acids in wrong compartment

These are **self molecules in wrong context**—the immune system detects contextual anomalies.

### PAMPs (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns)
Conserved microbial structures:
- **LPS**: Gram-negative bacterial cell wall
- **Flagellin**: Bacterial flagella
- **dsRNA**: Viral replication intermediate
- **CpG DNA**: Unmethylated bacterial DNA

PAMPs are dangerous because they **correlate with pathogens**—Bayesian inference of threat.

### Costimulation Requirement

**Two-signal model**:
1. **Signal 1**: TCR recognizes antigen-MHC (specificity)
2. **Signal 2**: Costimulatory molecules (B7 → CD28) indicate danger context

Without Signal 2, T cells become anergic (tolerance). Danger signals upregulate costimulation on antigen-presenting cells.

This is **context-gated activation**—same antigen, different outcome depending on danger context.

## Immune Privilege Reinterpreted

Classic view: Brain, eye are "immunologically privileged" because they're isolated.

Danger view: These tissues lack danger signals, so immune responses are not triggered. They are **low-danger environments**, not immune-free zones.

## Cancer Immunosurveillance

Danger theory predicts immune system monitors **cellular health**, not just foreignness:
- Cancer cells are **self** (genetically related)
- But they send stress signals (DNA damage, uncontrolled proliferation)
- Immune system recognizes these as **danger signals**

Tumor immune evasion involves **suppressing danger signals** and evading detection as "damaged self."

## Tolerance as Active Silencing

Danger theory implies tolerance requires:
- **Absence of danger signals** (not just absence of foreignness)
- **Presence of safety signals** (TGF-β, IL-10, CTLA-4)
- **Tregs as safety enforcers** (actively suppress responses in safe contexts)

The microbiome sends **safety signals**; dysbiosis breaks tolerance.

## Critique and Synthesis

Danger theory doesn't replace self-nonself but **refines** it:
- Self-nonself discrimination is real (thymic selection, clonal deletion)
- But activation requires danger context (costimulation, DAMPs)
- **Combined model**: Recognize non-self OR damaged-self, in context of danger

The immune system is a **multi-variable classifier**:
- Input 1: Self vs non-self
- Input 2: Safe vs dangerous
- Output: Tolerance vs immunity
