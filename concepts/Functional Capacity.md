# Functional Capacity

## Definition
The ability of a biological system to perform its characteristic functions. Not all configurations with equivalent conserved quantities have equal functional capacity—**quality matters, not just quantity**.

## Core Insight
Two tissue configurations may have identical:
- Total cell count
- Total protein mass
- Total metabolic flux

Yet differ dramatically in functional output because **organization determines function**.

## Examples Across Scales

### Molecular Level
- **Protein misfolding**: Same amino acid sequence, different fold → loss of function
- **Chromatin accessibility**: Same DNA sequence, different packaging → altered gene expression
- **Metabolic channeling**: Same enzymes, different spatial organization → different pathway efficiency

### Cellular Level
- **Cell differentiation**: Same genome, different epigenetic state → different functional capacity
- **Organelle distribution**: Same total mitochondria, different localization → variable ATP delivery
- **Cytoskeletal architecture**: Same tubulin concentration, different network topology → altered mechanical properties

### Tissue Level
- **Tissue architecture**: Same cell types, different spatial arrangement → impaired organ function
- **Vascular density**: Adequate total blood volume, poor capillary distribution → hypoxia
- **Neural connectivity**: Preserved neuron count, degraded synaptic organization → cognitive decline

### Organism Level
- **Cachexia**: Preserved total nitrogen, but muscle replaced by inflammatory tissue → functional decline
- **Aging**: Maintained cell number, accumulated damage → reduced capacity

## Measurement Challenge
How to quantify functional capacity beyond counting molecules?

**Approaches**:
1. **Performance metrics**: Direct functional output (force production, cognitive scores, metabolic rate)
2. **Structural quality**: Network topology, spatial organization, connectivity
3. **Response capacity**: Ability to respond to perturbations (see [[Transfer Functions]])
4. **Energetic efficiency**: Work per unit substrate

## Therapeutic Implication
Reversing pathology requires not just restoring **quantity** but rebuilding **quality**:
- [[Cachexia Inversion]]: Not just adding mass, but restoring functional tissue architecture
- [[Selective Catabolism]]: Preferentially removing low-quality components
- [[Dissection Quality Score]]: Explicit metric for evaluating reconfiguration quality
