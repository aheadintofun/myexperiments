Day 17 of [#ScienceAIBench](https://x.com/hashtag/ScienceAIBench?src=hashtag_click)! ![🎗️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f397.svg "Reminder ribbon") Today we focus on Oncology-related Kinases Inhibition. Protein kinases are the most common drug targets in cancer therapy. Kinase inhibitors are the backbone of modern targeted cancer therapy. Predicting how a small molecule interacts with specific kinase pockets is essential for designing selective drugs and avoiding off-target toxicity. Today’s benchmark utilizes the PKIS2 (Published Kinase Inhibitor Set 2) dataset via Polaris Hub, evaluating frontier models on their ability to predict inhibition profiles for three major receptor tyrosine kinases: RET (Thyroid cancer), KIT (GIST/Melanoma), and EGFR (Lung cancer). ![📋](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f4cb.svg "Clipboard") Benchmark Specifications: Task: Kinase Inhibition Prediction. Dataset: PKIS2 subset v2 (Drewry et al., 2017) via Polaris Hub. Targets: RET, KIT, and EGFR. Metric: Spearman Correlation. Models Evaluated: Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Flash, Deepseek 3.2, Grok 4.1, Sonnet 4.5, GPT 5.1, and GPT 5.2. ![📊](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f4ca.svg "Bar chart") Observed Performance: The Opus Dynasty: The Opus family dominates this benchmark. Opus 4.6 secured the top spot for RET (0.477) and EGFR (0.295), while the previous generation Opus 4.5 surprisingly outperformed the newer model on KIT (0.348), demonstrating robust chemical reasoning across versions. Strong Contender: Gemini 3 Flash proved to be the only competitive non-Opus model for RET, achieving a correlation of 0.468, virtually tying with the leaders. However, it struggled to generalize to KIT (0.151). Niche Performance: While generally mid-tier, Grok 4.1 showed surprising strength on EGFR (0.275), ranking third and outperforming Gemini 3 Flash on this specific target. The GPT Collapse: The GPT 5 series struggled immensely with this specific chemical space. GPT 5.2 failed to identify active compounds entirely, recording negative correlations for both RET (-0.067) and KIT (-0.063), due to a lack of valid outpits. ![🔄](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f504.svg "Anticlockwise downwards and upwards open circle arrows") Our daily series continues tomorrow.
