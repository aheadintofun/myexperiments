## Navigation Hubs

Start here for thematic exploration:

- **[Lattice and Spatial Modeling Hub](Lattice%20and%20Spatial%20Modeling%20Hub.md)** - Cellular automata, multi-scale lattices, spatial structure
- **[Biological Dynamics Hub](Biological%20Dynamics%20Hub.md)** - Perturbation-response, trajectories, phase transitions
- **[Genotype-to-Phenotype Hub](Genotype-to-Phenotype%20Hub.md)** - Variant effects, fitness landscapes, degeneracy
- **[Computational Biology Tools Hub](Computational%20Biology%20Tools%20Hub.md)** - Structure prediction, foundation models, protein design
- **[Tree of Life Hub](Tree%20of%20Life%20Hub.md)** - Major evolutionary transitions, abstract organizing principles

## Topics Covered

### AI Biology Tools (2024-2026)
- **2024**: AlphaFold 2, ProteinMPNN, RFdiffusion, ESM-2, DiffDock
- **2025**: Chai-1, Boltz-1, ESM3, OpenCRISPR-1 (open weights revolution)
- **2026**: AlphaGenome, Evo 2, AlphaFold 3, scGPT (foundation models)

### Mathematical Foundations
- State space, trajectories, attractors
- Fitness landscapes, epistasis
- Critical phenomena, phase transitions
- Turing pattern formation
- Renormalization and coarse-graining

### Universal Biological Abstractions
- Hierarchical composition (molecule → cell → tissue → organism)
- Perturbation-response-adaptation cycles
- Degeneracy and many-to-many mappings
- Context conditionality
- Information compression

### Phylogenetic Tree of Life
Major transitions with abstract focus:
- Origin of Life → Prokaryote to Eukaryote → Unicellular to Multicellular
- Plant-Animal Divergence → Vertebrate Innovations → Mammalian Innovations
- Organizing principles: Endosymbiosis, Developmental Toolkit, Cephalization

### Geometric Speculations
- DNA double helix as geodesic on constraint manifold
- Helical structures and octonionic geometry (S⁷, Hopf fibration, G₂)

### Cachexia & Vitality
- Cachexia as phase transition
- Hormesis and selective catabolism
- Therapeutic inversions

## Design Principles

Each concept note follows atomic Zettelkasten format:
- **15-35 lines** - Substantive but focused
- **Definition first** - Clear conceptual framing
- **Extensive cross-linking** - `[[wikilinks]]` to related concepts
- **Tags** - For discovery and clustering

The goal: **universal biological abstractions** that transcend specific domains (cancer, immunology, agriculture) and reveal shared computational patterns.
